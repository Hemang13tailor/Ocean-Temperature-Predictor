# Predicting Oceanic Heat Waves Using SST and Salinity

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting oceanic heat waves by analyzing historical sea surface temperature (SST) data and combining it with salinity measurements. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are employed to model and predict SST, aiding in better understanding and forecasting of marine heat wave events.

## Key Features
1. **Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Prediction**:
   - Using historical SST data to train LSTM models for accurate predictions also making it auto regressive.
   
2. **Incorporating Salinity**:
   - Enhanced prediction accuracy by combining salinity data with SST.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Implementation of deep learning techniques (LSTM) to handle sequential data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model
  - NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization
- **Datasets**: Historical SST and salinity data (e.g., from NOAA or INCOIS)
